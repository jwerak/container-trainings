# Introduction

## Microservice

... the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API ...

Martin Fowler

* Microservice is architecture (and development style)
* It isn't a deployment model

???

* Various dependencies
* Easier development
* Easy rollout/rollback

code pipeline - focus on shipping the code
infrastructure as a code - describe infrastructure and use it to run code

---
## Architectures

- Application run on baremetal server
  - isolated HW

--

- VMs are running on top of it
  - decoupled from HW
  - multiple kernel, HW isolated

--

- Application is running in containers
  - shared kernel
  - simplified management

???

* focus on shipping the code

---
## Containers are for

- microservices
- stateless

## How Containers contain

[cgroups](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html)

* in kernel since 2008 (2.6.24)
* created by Google


* resource limitations
* resource prioritization
* accounting
* state control (frozen, restarted)

---
## How Containers contain

[linux namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)

| Namespace | Purpose                                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| mnt       | Mount points                                |
| pid       | Provide independent process IDs             |
| net       | Networking stack                            |
| ipc       | Inter-process communication                 |
| uts       | Provide different host and domain names     |
| uid       | Privilege isolation and user identification |
| cgroup    | Prevent leaking control-group               |

## Docker

Platform for managing containers, images and other resources. It bundles together existing technologies to provide easier management for containers environment.

.center[

???

dotCloud open-sources their container engine and that engine became docker.

---
## OCI

[Open Container Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/)

Project to design open standards for Linux containers and virtualization.

Contain specification for containers:
* [runtime-spec](http://www.github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec)
* [image-spec](http://www.github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)

???
* https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md
* https://github.com/projectatomic/skopeo

runtime specification outlines how to run a "filesystem bundle" that is unpacked on disk

---
# Container Image

* elementary block of a container
* stores files (not filesystem) - like tar
* similar purpose like image for VM
* read-only sharable layers
* ways to build image:
  * `docker build`
  * `docker commit`
  * `docker import`
  * `buildah` - [projectatomic/buildah](https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah)

---
## Working with images

* Never use Docker hub in production!
* Download image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
  * `docker pull python:3.6`
* List images
  * `docker images`
* Tag (rename) image
  * `docker tag python:3.6 jwerak/mypython:3.6`
* Push image
  * `docker push jwerak/mypython:3.6`
* Remove image
  * `docker rmi jwerak/mypython:3.6`

---
## Image names

.center[
```
quay.io/jwerak/python:3.6
|_____| |____| |_____||_|
registry dir    name tag
```
]

* default **registry** is `docker.io` (references [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/))
* default **tag** is `latest`


???
* --add-registry on RHEL/Fedora - /etc/sysconfig/docker
* https://access.redhat.com/articles/1354823

---
## Lab: image basics

1. Download image called `hello-world`
1. Tag this image to `hello-training:{{ date }}`
1. What is image ID of this image? And original image?

Extras:
* Try to run container with this image by `docker run --rm hello-world`
* List all tags for `hello-world` image
  * https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/
  * `skopeo inspect docker://hello-world`


---
# Container

Container is "process" running in an isolated environment.

.small[
```bash
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID IMAGE    COMMAND                CREATED      STATUS      PORTS     NAMES
ee984e0ade27 spotify  "spotify"              7 hours ago  Up 7 hours            spotify
9d6c4eb26908 mariadb  "docker-entrypoint.sh" 7 days ago   Up 32 hours 3306/tcp  fran_db_1
6172469c1af8 rabbitmq "docker-entrypoint.sh" 2 weeks ago  Up 32 hours 4369/tcp  fran_mq_1
```
]

* Container storage is ephemeral

---
## Starting the container

1. User runs command
  * `docker run ubuntu:latest`
1. `docker` CLI connects to docker daemon
1. `docker` daemon check if image is present
1. images is pulled if missing - !!!
1. image is used to create container
1. network and storage can be allocated (will be described later)
1. new (and changed) files are stored in read-write layer

* We can attach to console of running container
* Run `docker` to get all possible actions

---
## Start container

* Run process in container
  * `docker run debian hostname --fqdn`
* Run process in container and do interactive attach
  * `docker run --rm -ti debian bash`
* Run detached container
  * `docker run -d debian ping kubernetes.io`
* List containers (`-a` includes stopped)
  * `docker ps -a`

---
## Interacting with container

* Attach to running container
  * `docker attach container_id_or_name`
  * `Ctrl + p, Ctrl + q` can be used to detach from container
* Get information about container
  * `docker inspect container_id_or_name`
* Run another process in container
  * `docker exec -ti container_id_or_name bash`
* Print logs of process in container
  * `docker logs container_id_or_name -f`
* Stop all running containers (not recommended for production ...)
  * `docker stop $(docker ps -q)`

---
## Other Docker commands

* `build`: Build an image from a Dockerfile
* `cp`: Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem
* `exec`: Run a command in a running container
* `images`: List images
* `stop`: Stop one or more running containers
* `kill`: Kill one or more running containers
* `ps`: List containers
* `restart`: Restart one or more containers
* `rm`: Remove one or more containers
* `rmi`: Remove one or more images
* `tag`: Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE


---
## Lab: Backup MySQL database

1. Start MySQL database in container
  * `docker run --name db -d -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=1 mariadb`
1. Create database `workshop`
  * Command to execute in container: `mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE workshop"`
1. List databases
  * SQL command `SHOW DATABASES`
1. Backup directory `/var/lib/mysql/` from container to host
1. What is the size of this backup?
1. Can you find another way to backup database?

---
# Building images

.left-column[
## Writing Dockerfile

* Recommended way
* We want to have "reproducible" images
* `Dockerfile` is plain text
* Build is performed by docker daemon (or `buildah`)
* Build creates an image
* Use version control
* [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
]

--
.right-column[
## Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM debian

LABEL maintainer="Jakub Veverka"

RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y curl procps && \
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY build_out/app /bin/

CMD ["/bin/app"]
```

* `docker build -t myimage .`
* Build uses cache - will speed up build process
]


---
## Important Dockerfile Instructions
* `FROM image` sets base image
* `LABEL key value` add labels to the image
* `ENV key value` set environment variable
* `RUN` executes commands in image
* `WORKDIR dir` set current working directory
* `ADD src dest` copies new files
* `CMD cmd` default command to be executed in container
* `EXPOSE port` inform about open ports
* `VOLUME volume` create mount point with volume
* `ENTRYPOINT` configure executable for container
* Each command creates new layer

???
* ADD vs COPY: add can get URL or tar

---
## One Container == One process

* Philosophy: containers are meant to do one thing only
* process dies => container dies
* **PID 1** & signal handling
* one stdout/stderr from container

---
## CMD & ENTRYPOINT

```Dockerfile
CMD ping localhost
=> /bin/sh -c ‘ping localhost’
```

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT[“ping”]
CMD[“localhost”]
=> ping localhost
$ docker run my_container www.google.com
  => ping www.google.com
```

---
## LAB: Create Dockerfile

* Create Dockerfile for image that will `ping localhost` on startup
  * Start container to verify that ping goes to localhost
* Update Dockerfile to change ping endpoint for each run

---
## Shell vs Exec Form

```Dockerfile
CMD[“ping”, “localhost”]
=> /bin/ping localhost
```

---
## LAB: Shell vs Exec Form

* Update Dockerfile to change ping endpoint based on ENV variable
  * Hint: mind when environmental variable is evaluated

---
## PID1

.lc[
* Container have it's own PID namespaces
* PID 1 process is special, usually `init`
* Please don't run init in containers


* Is responsible for:
  * collection zombies
  * handling signals


* `docker run --init` is a (bad) way
* Running scripts in containers - make sure exec is used

  * Bad: `nging`
  * Good: `exec nginx`
* Shell form vs exec form

  * Shell: `CMD /start.sh`
  * Exec: `CMD ["/start.sh"]`
]

--

.rc[
### Wrong
```bash
PID COMMAND
  1 /bin/bash /start.sh
  8 nginx: master process nginx -g daemon off;
  9  \_ nginx: worker process
```


### Right
```bash
PID COMMAND
  1 nginx: master process nginx -g daemon off;
  8 nginx: worker process
```
]

---
## LAB: PID1

* Build container image from https://github.com/jwerak/container-trainings/tree/master/labs/dockerfile-PID1
* Start container and execute `ps aux` in this container
* Which process have PID 1? Is it `nginx`?
* Use `time docker stop {{ container }}` to stop container and observe **total** time to stop containers

* Fix issue with PID 1 (`nginx` process should have PID 1), and repeat from point **1**
* How long does it take to stop container with proper PID?
